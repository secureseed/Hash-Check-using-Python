# Hash-Check-using-Python
This program is a small illustration as to how one can use python to search for hashes in a local repository or via Virustotal

**How to execute the program:** 
  Run the Hash_Check.bat file and that will automatically open a command prompt dialogue box with the options.
  
**Future notes:**
  The project will further incorporate hash verification from many other sites like virustotal.
